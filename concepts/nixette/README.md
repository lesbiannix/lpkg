# Nixette ‚Äì Declarative, Sourceful, and Unapologetically Herself

A playful concept distro imagined as the transfemme child of **NixOS** and **Gentoo**. Nixette blends the reproducible confidence of flakes with the fine-grained self-expression of USE flags, wrapped in a trans flag palette and a big, affirming hug.

## Identity Snapshot

## Feature Mix

| Pillar                | How Nixette expresses it                                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reproducibility      | Flake-native system definitions with versioned profiles (`comfort-zone`, `diy-princess`, `studio-mode`). |
| Custom compilation   | `nix emerge` bridge turns Gentoo ebuild overlays into reproducible derivations with cached binaries.      |
| Playful polish       | Catppuccin-trans themes, `nixette-style` CLI to sync GTK/Qt/terminal styling, dynamic welcome affirmations.|
| Inclusive defaults   | Flatpak + Steam pre-set for accessibility tools, Fcitx5, Orca, speech-dispatcher, pronoun-friendly docs.  |

## Toolchain Concepts

- **`trans-init` installer** ‚Äì Guided TUI that outputs `flake.nix`, including overlays for the `nix emerge` bridge. Provides story-mode narration for first boot.
- **`nixette-style`** ‚Äì Syncs wallpapers, SDDM theme, terminal palette, Qt/KDE settings, all sourced from a YAML theme pack.
- **`emerge-optional`** ‚Äì Spins up Gentoo chroots inside Nix build sandboxes for packages happiest as ebuilds. Output is cached as a Nix store derivation.
- **`affirm-d`** ‚Äì Small daemon rotating `/etc/motd`, desktop notifications, and TTY colour accents with inclusive affirmations.

- Design additional wallpapers (night mode, pride variants, low-light).
- Draft inclusive documentation templates (issue/PR forms, community guidelines).
- Publish a community pledge emphasising safety, pronoun respect, and boundaries.
- Host monthly "compile & chill" streams to showcase contributions.

Let Nixette be the distro that compiles joy, not just binaries. üíú
